## Conclusion
In this lesson, you learned the basics of Alternator: the open-source DynamoDB Scylla API. You saw how to create a cluster, connect to it, write data, and read data. Future lessons will cover more advanced topics and more interesting examples, including data modeling, backup and restore, single region vs. multi-region, streams (CDC), encryption at rest, and more.
