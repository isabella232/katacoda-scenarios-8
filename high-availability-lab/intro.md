This lab demonstrates, using a hands-on example, how Availability works in Scylla. You’ll try setting the Replication Factor and Consistency Levels in a three-node cluster and you’ll see how they affect read and write operations when all of the nodes in the cluster are up, and also when some of them are unavailable.

This lab is part of [Scylla University](https://university.scylladb.com).
